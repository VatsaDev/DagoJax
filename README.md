Making a full process from data collection to GRPO for a decent Mini model

Features/roadmap:

 - [ ] Full JAX rewrite
 - [ ] Webscraping, HF downloads, Annas Archive, etc to text files in a folder
 - [ ] Multiple tokenizers, chars, BPE
 - [x] Sharded Data loader, txt files to config sizeable bin shards
 - [x] Modeled out base LM arch, Dense Transformer, DS-MoE, MLA+NSA, RoPE, KVcache
   - [ ] other experimentals (MLP-mixer, etc)
 - [ ] Multimodal Input (Image, audio/video)
 - [ ] Training strats, like Curriculum learning, interleaving data, etc (settle as I code)
 - [ ] Layer 2 thinking (KV deliberation, memory layers, byte latent, theory of mind, Quiet Star, CocoNut, settle as I code)
 - [ ] Fully distributed Training Runs
   - [x] 0D (1 GPU)
   - [ ] DDP
   - [ ] FSDP
   - [ ] TP
   - [ ] CP
   - [ ] EP
   - [ ] Pipelining
 - [x] SFT (take train checkpoint, add sft_iters to max_iters, put sft dataset in)
 - [ ] Posttraining (PRM, RLHF, TULU, settle as I code)
 - [ ] RL (probably GRPO)
 - [ ] Inference
   - [ ] Sampler settings (topk, topp, minp, temp, etc)
   - [x] KV Cache
 - [ ] websearch / tool use / Mech interp tricks (Activation boosting/patching, hallucination circuits, refusal circuits, control vectors, settle as I code)
 - [ ] benchmark evaluation script + benchmark numbers

Deprecated Features (were tested, removed):

 - MTP: It needs scale to work, probably need 7b+
 - Mixture of a Million experts and Ultra Mem: I liked them, but its oddities and other performance issues force me to stay away, may keep just MoM though, more robust
